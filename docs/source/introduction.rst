What is ALPINE?
===============

ALPINE is a data and visualization software project under development as part of the Department of Energy's `Exascale Computing Project`_ (ECP).  ALPINE will deliver exascale-ready in situ data analysis and visualization capabilities to ECP science applications.

ALPINE capabilities include infrastructure, analysis and visualization algorithms, and compression.  This documentation will focus on ALPINE aglorithms.  Links are provided to access information and documentation about ALPINE infrastructure and zfp compression.

This is a work in progress.  New algorithms and documentation will be added as needed in the future.  

All of our software is open source and available at the links noted within the documentation.
