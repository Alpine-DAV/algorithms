Adaptive Sampling
=================

Overview
^^^^^^^^
Sampling is an in situ data reduction approach for the scalar datasets generated by the scientific simulations. This generic feature-driven data reduction method is applicable for any regular-grid datasets at this stage and us available through Ascent as a VTK-m/VTK-h filter. This generic sampling method essentially analyzes the scalar data distribution and automatically assigns importance to the scalars. Since the scientific datasets generally contain features where the scientists are primarily interested in, this distribution-driven sampling approach tries to identify the important regions of the dataset based on the probability of occurrence. Features of the data generally span much fewer data points compared to the background ("non-interesting") regions of the data. Utilizing this idea, our sampling approach assigns more importance to the low probability scalars and less importance to the highly frequent scalars.

The sampling method operates by creating a point representation of the selected data points at the in situ processing phase. These data points can then be restored back to its original size/resolution by an inverse operation or these samples can be directly visualized as a preview of the dataset using visualization tools (such as Paraview).

To achieve sampling, first, the histogram of the dataset is created. Histograms, used as a representation of the data distribution, are used for identifying and assigning importance to the individual scalars.  In this approach, the goal of sampling to pick an equal number of samples from each bin and since bins have varying frequencies, it, in turn, assigns high importance to the scalars in the bins that have a low count.
More details of the approach can be found in this paper:
